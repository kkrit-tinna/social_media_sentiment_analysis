Data trimming tips
ex.
Notice the platform 'twitter' is counted twice, thus more data trimming is required to reflect accuracy
This incident is usually due to the following reasons:
1. case sensitivity
-- solution: standardize the case before counting by converting all text to lowercase (or uppercase)
sentiment_data['platform'] = sentiment_data['platform'].str.lower()
2. leading or trailing space
-- solution: remove extra spaces
sentiment_data['Platform'] = sentiment_data['Platform'].str.strip()
3. Duplicates in the Dataset
-- already duplicate checks
4. hidden characters
-- solution: inspect the unique values to check for these anomalies
print(sentiment_data['platform'].unique())
